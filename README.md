<h1>GameBrain!</h1>
<p>A video-game recommendation engine built as a way to learn about APIs. Users can 
search in the Rawg.io database and see a list of games they might be interested in.

Upon clicking the more information link they will be shown in depth info about the game 
as well as embeded YouTube videos of reviews.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>I have always loved video games and I especially like finding "hidden gems" that I might have missed
when they first came out.  GameBrain gave me a way to move ahead in my programming studies, as well as a 
fun tool to discover new games.</p>

<h2>Initial Concepts/Features/User Stories</h2>
<p>Lets the user find their next video game to play by asking them a short series of questions.  
The app will then give a list of games with each game having some basic info, screen shots, links 
to ebay for the game itself and the system(s) it came out on, and links to reviews on YouTube.  
This app will utilize the RAWG Video Games Database API, the ebay Find API, and the YouTube Data API.</p>

Due to time contstraints, I whittled down some of the features I initially considered in order to get a working
project finished.
